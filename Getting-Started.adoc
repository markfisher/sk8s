= Getting Started with riff

Riff is designed to use https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] features for running Functions in response to Events.
This guide covers installing riff using https://helm.sh/[Helm], which is a commonly used package manager for Kubernetes. 

== Prerequisites

* A running 1.7+ Kubernetes cluster

* Kubernetes CLI `kubectl` installed and on the local system PATH. We recommend using the same version or later as the Kubernetes cluster you are using.

* Docker, if you plan on building samples or your own functions then you will need Docker installed. We have used Docker version 17.x or later.

== [[helm]]Install Helm

Helm is comprised of two components: one is the client (helm) the other is the server component (tiller). The helm client runs on your local machine and can be installed using the instructions found https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/README.md#install[here]

Once you have the helm client installed you can install the server component.

For a cluster that does not have RBAC enabled use:

[source, bash]
----
helm init
----

[NOTE]
====
It gets a bit more complicated if the cluster has RBAC enabled. The Helm project describes the https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#best-practices-for-securing-helm-and-tiller[Best Practices for Securing Helm and Tiller] in their documentation. This can be fairly involved and for less critical development clusters it is easier to configure the Helm tiller server to run with cluster-admin privileges using a service account in the `kube-system` namespace. You should have cluster admin rights and run the following:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl -n kube-system create serviceaccount tiller
kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller --clusterrole cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller
helm init --service-account=tiller
----

====

TIP: To verify that the tiller pod has started execute the following command: `kubectl get pod --namespace kube-system -l app=helm` and you should see the `tiller` pod running.

== [[riff-repo]]Add the riff repository to your helm configuration

Riff offers helm charts for deploying the FaaS and its required services to a Kubernetes Cluster.
The following instructions cover how to configure helm to be able to install the riff charts.

Run the following commands to add the repository:

[source, bash]
----
helm repo add projectriff https://riff-charts.storage.googleapis.com
helm repo update
----

Run the following command to see that the `riff` chart is available and also what versions you can install:

[source, bash]
----
helm search riff -l
----

== [[current]]Install the current riff release

We provide a lightweight single node Kafka installation with the `projectriff/kafka` chart. 
This works well for development purposes and it can be installed together with the riff chart by providing `--set kafka.create=true` when installing the riff chart.

=== Create riff-system namespace

All riff components willbe deployed into a `riff-system` namespace. 
Any functions that are developed can be deployed into any other namespace including the `default` namespace.

To create the `riff-system` namespace run:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl create namespace riff-system
----

=== Create the required kafka instance

You'll need a kafka instance to support the http-gateway and topic controller components.   You can install a single node dev-quality instance:

[source, bash]
----
helm install --name transport --namespace riff-system projectriff/kafka
----
[TIP]
====
The name of the helm chart *must* be `transport`
====

If you want a full blown 3 node kafka environment (with its much higher resource requirements), install the one provided by Kubeapps `incubator/kafka`:
[source, bash]
----
helm install --name transport --namespace riff-system incubator/kafka
----


=== RBAC considerations

If using a cluster with RBAC enabled/disabled, you'll need to make sure you add `--set rbac.create=true` or `--set rbac.create=false` as appropriate.

=== Install riff using a Kubernetes cluster supporting LoadBalancer (e.g. kops)

Install the riff helm chart as follows:

For an install with default configuration and no RBAC enabled use (this assumes you used the dev kafka defined above):

[source, bash]
----
helm install projectriff/riff --name projectriff --namespace riff-system --set kafka.create=true --set rbac.create=false
----
if you used the three node kafka instance, use

[source, bash]
----
helm install projectriff/riff --name projectriff --namespace riff-system --set kafka.broker.nodes=transport-kafka.riff-system:9092 --set kafka.zookeeper.nodes=transport-zookeeper.riff-system:2181 --set rbac.create=false
----


=== Install riff using a Kubernetes cluster not supporting LoadBalancer (e.g. minikube)

For `NodePort` service types (e.g. running on Minikube) configure the httpGateway to use `NodePort`:

[source, bash]
----
helm install projectriff/riff --name projectriff --namespace riff-system --set kafka.create=true --set rbac.create=false --set httpGateway.service.type=NodePort
----


=== Verify the installation

You should see a number of resources get created in your cluster. You can see them all using:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl get -n riff-system crd,svc,deploy,pod
----

=== Components installed by the chart

The provided Helm chart installs the following components:

* CustomResourceDefinitions for invokers, functions and topics

* Topic Controller - the controller that watches the Topic resources and creates new topics in Kafka

* Function Controller - the controller that watches the Function resources and deploys function images together with the sidecar image

* HTTP Gateway - the external facing gateway that listens for data posted to the various topics and forwards the data as a message for the corresponding Kafka topic

=== To upgrade to a new version

Assuming that you named your release `projectriff` you can run the following command to upgrade to the latest released version:

TIP: Older instructions used `demo` for the release name and `riffrepo` as the name for riff's Helm repository. You should substitute `projectriff` with `demo` and `projectriff/riff` with `riffrepo/riff` if you have an older riff install. Another option is to remove the old install using `helm delete --purge demo` and then follow the instructions link:Getting-Started.adoc#riff-repo[above] for installing the new version.

[source, bash]
----
helm repo update
helm upgrade projectriff projectriff/riff
----

=== To tear it all down

[source, bash]
----
helm delete --purge projectriff
helm delete --purge transport
----

== [[CLI]]Install the current riff CLI tool

We provide a CLI tool written in Go that makes it easy to create and deploy functions.
Install the CLI by following the instructions on the https://github.com/projectriff/riff/releases[riff release page].

=== [[cli-config]]riff CLI configuration

The riff CLI can be configured either using environment variables or using a config file. 
The config file to be used can be set using `--config` option and it defaults to `$HOME/.riff.yaml`.

Environment variables are prefixed with `RIFF_` and the variables from the following example are supported:

```
RIFF_VERSION=0.0.6-snapshot
RIFF_USERACCOUNT=myaccount
RIFF_NAMESPACE=test
```

For the config file, you can create a `~/.riff.yaml` file with something like the following content:

```
riffVersion: 0.0.6-snapshot
useraccount: myaccount
namespace: test
```

=== [[cli-completion]]riff CLI bash completion

The riff CLI command supports generating a bash completion file in the same way as the `kubectl` command does.

==== [[cli-completion-macos]]riff CLI bash completion on macOS

If you use https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] on a Mac you can install the completion file using:

```
brew install bash-completion
riff completion bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/riff 
```

==== [[cli-completion-linux]]riff CLI bash completion on Linux

If you use Linux you can installl the completion file using:

```
. <(riff completion bash) 
```

TIP: You can edit your `.bashrc` file to have this automatically loaded on future shell runs.
