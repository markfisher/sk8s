## Problem
Many Kubernetes resources that decompose to Pods (like Deployment, ReplicaSet, Job, etc) embed a [PodTemplateSpec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.11/#podtemplatespec-v1-core) at `.spec.template`. This not only makes these resources easier for users and tools to consume, it facilitates duck typed operations on resources that follow this pattern. riff doesn't follow this pattern, as our resources embed a [PodSpec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.11/#podspec-v1-core) at `.spec.template` instead. The PodTemplateSpec contains inlined ObjectMeta in addition to the PodSpec; this enables adding custom labels and/or annotations to the resulting Pod.

## Solution
riff should switch all usage of PodSpec at `.spec.template` to be a PodTemplateSpec.

Specifically:
- deployers.core.projectriff.io
- deployers.knative.projectriff.io
- processors.streaming.projectriff.io

### User Impact
This is a breaking change. Users will need to move the current content of `.spec.template` to `.spec.template.spec`, since the former will now be the `PodTemplateSpec` and the latter will be the `PodSpec` within that template.

### Backwards Compatibility and Upgrade Path
This is a breaking change for our CRDs. The impact can be minimized if the CLI is updated at the same time as the system and charts. No automatic migration will be performed.

Since our APIs are still alpha, breaking changes are permitted without a version bump.
