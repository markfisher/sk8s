## Problem

The current relationship between a `Stream` and a `(InMemory|Kafka|Pulsar)Provider` is fragile. The stream contains a hostname for the provider's provisioner, which the stream controller calls when reconciling the stream. This has a few problems:
- the `Stream` resource doesn't know when the `Provider` is unavailable, or deleted
- the `Stream` has no way to automatically obtain a new address for the provisioner
- the provisioner name is competing in the `Service` namespace. The likelihood of a name collision is reduced by appending a suffix to the service name. However, the user must include this suffix when creating each stream
- as new providers are created, there is a significant amount of reconciliation logic that is duplicated with trivial differences

The problem is derived from [projectriff/system#86](https://github.com/projectriff/system/issues/86).

### Anti-Goals

This RFC will not prevent naming collisions between different provisioners within the same namespace. The first gateway of a given name wins.

## Solution

1. Rename `*Provider` to `*Gateway`

   The high level role of the whole component is that of a gateway. 

1. Introduce a `Gateway` resource which creates a single `Deployment` and `Service`

   This reduces the toil of adding a new `*Gateway` reconciler as the boilerplate code will be encapsulated. It is recommended that users not create this resource directly. Rather one of these _abstract_ `Gateway`s will be created for each _concrete_ `*Gateway` resource within the latter's reconciler as described below.
   
   1. Cohabitate the gateway (liiklus) and provisioner `Deployment`s and `Service`s

      A single `Deployment` with two containers and a single `Service` with two ports can replace the current two Deployments and two Services per provider. Eventually we may extend the gateway spec and implementation (currently liiklus) so that the provisioning role is handled by the same container (a new RFC would be created to capture that plan).

   1. Update each existing `*Gateway` to reconcile to a `Gateway`

1. Update `Stream` resource with a LocalObjectReference to its `Gateway`

   The `Stream` reconciler can track the `Gateway` and include the `Gateway`'s Ready condition as one of its conditions. `Processor`s already track each input and output `Stream`'s Ready condition to scale down the processor when a stream goes red.

1. Update Streaming CRDs status for new relationships

  Changes to the reconciliation object graph invalidate many of the existing status references.

### User Impact

The CRDs and CLI commands for streaming providers will replace `provider` with `gateway`. The stream create command will rename the `--provider` flag to `--gateway` with the value as the gateway's name (with no suffix needed).

### Backwards Compatibility and Upgrade Path

All existing behavior is being preserved. Since the streaming runtime has not been released, there is no release to be backwards incompatible with.
