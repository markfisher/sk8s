The following declarations determine the docker images and kubernetes configuration files that are used by all packages
in this repository. To preserve this consistency, the declarations are shared between the main packages. This ensures
that other packages do not import the declarations directly but must rely on the values being injected and passed as
parameters.

This file is defined in the root of this repository and symbolically linked from other main packages such as that in
./distro.
