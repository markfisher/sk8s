=== [[manual]] Manual install of riff

==== Prerequisites

You need:

* A running 1.7+ Kubernetes cluster. These instructions assume minikube for now.
+
TIP: We recommend using Minikube v0.23.0 or v0.24.1 and avoiding v0.24.0 due to some DNS issues
+
[source,bash]
----
minikube start
----

* Git installed.

* A Java 8 environment.

* A working Go environment, with clones of the 
https://github.com/projectriff/function-sidecar[function-sidecar], 
https://github.com/projectriff/function-controller[function-controller],
https://github.com/projectriff/topic-controller[topic-controller] and 
https://github.com/projectriff/http-gateway[http-gateway] repositories.
+
[source, bash]
----
cd $(go env GOPATH)   #defaults to ~/go
git clone -o upstream https://github.com/projectriff/function-sidecar src/github.com/projectriff/function-sidecar/
git clone -o upstream https://github.com/projectriff/function-controller src/github.com/projectriff/function-controller/
git clone -o upstream https://github.com/projectriff/topic-controller src/github.com/projectriff/topic-controller/
git clone -o upstream https://github.com/projectriff/http-gateway src/github.com/projectriff/http-gateway/
----

* A clone of the 
https://github.com/projectriff/riff[riff], 
https://github.com/projectriff/java-function-invoker[java-function-invoker], 
https://github.com/projectriff/node-function-invoker[node-function-invoker], 
https://github.com/projectriff/shell-function-invoker[shell-function-invoker] and 
https://github.com/projectriff/python2-function-invoker[python2-function-invoker] repos.
+
NOTE: These repos should be cloned under a unique root directory since we will be using relative paths during the build.
+
[source, bash]
----
#cd <some_root_dir>
git clone -o upstream https://github.com/projectriff/riff.git
git clone -o upstream https://github.com/projectriff/java-function-invoker.git
git clone -o upstream https://github.com/projectriff/node-function-invoker.git
git clone -o upstream https://github.com/projectriff/shell-function-invoker.git
git clone -o upstream https://github.com/projectriff/python2-function-invoker.git
----

From now on, this README assumes you're running commands from the `riff` repository clone:

[source, bash]
----
cd riff
----

==== Point your local Docker environment to the Docker environment running in minikube

[source, bash]
----
eval $(minikube docker-env)
----

==== Build the core riff components

This builds the Function Sidecar, HTTP Gateway, Topic Controller, and Function Controller:

[source, bash]
----
./build-function-sidecar
./build-http-gateway
./build-topic-controller
./build-function-controller
----

==== Build the function invokers

This builds the `java-function-invoker`, `node-function-invoker`, `shell-function-invoker`, and `python2-function-invoker`:

[source, bash]
----
./build-function-invokers
----

==== Deploy Kafka/Zookeeper

[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f config/kafka
----

==== Deploy the riff custom resources

This creates the Function and Topic CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions):

[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f config/types
----

==== Deploy the riff core components

This deploys the HTTP Gateway, Topic Controller, and Function Controller:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f config
----

If your cluster has RBAC enabled, then you also need to create a Role and a RoleBinding:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f config/rbac
----

==== To tear it all down

Once you're done playing with riff (see samples below), you can destroy everything created above by running

[source, bash]
----
./teardown
----

== [[samples]]Try Some Samples

With riff running try some of the link:samples/README.adoc[samples].
