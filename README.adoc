= A FaaS for Kubernetes

The riff CLI helps developers build and run functions using link:https://github.com/knative/docs[Knative].
It includes commands to install Knative in a Kubernetes cluster, and for managing functions, services, channels, and subscriptions.

== Installation of the latest release

Official binary release are available from the link:https://github.com/projectriff/riff/releases[Releases] page. See link:https://projectriff.io/docs/getting-started-with-knative-riff-on-minikube/[Getting started on Minikube] or
link:https://projectriff.io/docs/getting-started-with-knative-riff-on-gke/[Getting started on GKE] for how to install the riff CLI and the riff system.

See link:Community-Releases.adoc[Community releases] for Mac Homebrew and Debian Apt packages.

== Developer installation of Knative

The code for Knative serving and eventing and build lives in repos under the link:https://github.com/knative[knative] GitHub organization. Developers can use the riff CLI against their own Knative builds, by installing a link:https://github.com/knative/eventing/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md[Knative development environment].

== [[manual]] Manual build of the riff CLI

This is the best option if you want to modify the riff CLI.

NOTE: Changes since the last release mean that the riff CLI built from the master branch will behave slightly differently from the released version. Please refer to the CLI link:https://github.com/projectriff/riff/blob/master/docs/riff.md[documentation] or use `--help` for more details.  
`riff function create` no longer uses an invoker argument. Use an `--invoker` flag instead to override language detection in the buildpack. All builds now use our buildpacks v3 link:https://github.com/projectriff/riff-buildpack-group[builder].
