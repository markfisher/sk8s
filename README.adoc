See link:Development-Helm-install.adoc[Installing the riff development version using Helm] to install the latest unreleased builds (git master branch) of riff.

=== [[manual]] Manual build

This is the best option if you want to modify the riff components.

==== Prerequisites

You need:

* A local 1.7+ Kubernetes cluster and docker
* A working Go environment

==== Get the main riff repo and install the CLI

[source, bash]
----
go get github.com/projectriff/riff
----

==== Build the riff core components

[source, bash]
----
cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/projectriff/riff
make dockerize
----

==== Deploy Kafka

[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f config/kafka
----

==== Deploy the riff Custom Resource Definitions

[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f config/types
----

==== Deploy the riff core components

This deploys the HTTP Gateway, Topic Controller, and Function Controller:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f config
----

If your cluster has RBAC enabled, then you also need to create a Role and a RoleBinding:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f config/rbac
----

==== To tear it all down

Once you're done playing with riff (see samples below), you can destroy everything created above by running

[source, bash]
----
./teardown
----
