A FaaS for Kubernetes

== Installation of the latest release

See link:Getting-Started.adoc[Getting Started] for how to install riff with a Helm Chart,
and how to install the riff CLI.

== Developer installation

See link:Development-Helm-install.adoc[Installing the riff development version using Helm] to install the latest unreleased builds (git master branch) of riff.

== [[manual]] Manual build

This is the best option if you want to modify the riff components.

=== Prerequisites

You need:

* A working Go environment
* A local 1.7+ Kubernetes cluster
* A docker daemon

To build images with docker in minikube use

[source, bash]
----
eval $(minikube docker-env)
----

=== Get the main riff repo and install the CLI

[source, bash]
----
go get github.com/projectriff/riff
----

=== Build the riff core components

[source, bash]
----
cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/projectriff/riff
make dockerize
----

=== Setup for development

If you want to quickly standup a development copy of Riff:

[source, bash]
----
make dev-setup
----

Which will:

* Create a `riff-system` namespace
* Deploy a non-replicated Kafka broker
* Install Riff CRDs and system components

=== Deploying with RBAC

If your cluster has RBAC enabled, then you also need to create a Role and a RoleBinding:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f config/rbac
----

=== To tear it all down

Once you're done playing with riff (see samples below), you can destroy everything created above by running:

[source, bash]
----
make teardown
----

== [[samples]]Try Some Samples

With riff running try some of the link:samples/README.adoc[samples].

== Running the tests

To run all riff's unit and integration tests, ensure Kafka (with `auto.create.topics.enable=true`, which
is the default) and Zookeeper are running locally, then issue:

[source, bash]
----
KAFKA_BROKERS=localhost:9092 KAFKA_BROKER=localhost:9092 make test
----
